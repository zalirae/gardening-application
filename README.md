# Gardening App

Create and tend a cozy terminal garden ‚Äî water, fertilise, plant seeds, and save or load your plants.

This app is a simple, text-based and interactive game that gives the user a sense of control over their garden ‚Äî encouraging imagination about what that space might look like. It was really enjoyable to design and build the different functions, figuring out how they work together to create an interactive experience.

A virtual environment was used to install the necessary packages and libraries: **Colorama** (to colourise and diversify text) and **Questionary** (to create user-friendly command-line menus navigated with arrow keys).

My intention in creating this style of game or app is to evoke a sense of peace within the user ‚Äî a garden space that is meditative to navigate and satisfying to participate in.

---

## Quickstart

### 1) (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment

```bash
# macOS / Linux
python3 -m venv .venv || python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Windows PowerShell
py -m venv .venv   # or: python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Windows CMD
py -m venv .venv   # or: python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

### 2) Install dependencies

```bash
# If 'pip' fails, try 'pip3' (macOS/Linux) or 'py -m pip' (Windows)
pip install colorama==0.4.6 questionary==2.0.1 pytest==8.3.3
```

### 3) Run

```bash
# Use the Python you activated above
python -m gardening_app   # or: python3 -m gardening_app | py -m gardening_app (Windows)
```

---

## System Requirements

- Python 3.9 or later (recommended)
- Internet connection (for initial package installation only)
- Terminal or command-line access (Windows PowerShell, macOS Terminal, or Linux Shell)
- Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux

---

## Features

- üåª **Show Garden** ‚Äî Displays all plants currently growing in your garden.
- üíß **Water Garden** ‚Äî Keeps plants healthy; shows feedback messages using colour.
- üåø **Fertilise Soil** ‚Äî Boosts growth and shows a readiness message.
- üå∞ **Plant Seeds** ‚Äî Lets you add ‚Äúorange tree‚Äù or ‚Äúpumpkin‚Äù to your garden.
- üíæ **Save Garden** ‚Äî Saves your garden‚Äôs state to a local JSON file.

</p>

### Future Improvements

- Add a **Pick/Harvest** feature to align with the ‚Äúready to be picked‚Äù message, allowing users to collect or remove plants from their garden.
- Track harvested items, add growth stages, and display simple ASCII visuals.

---

## Data & Save File

Garden data is stored locally in a file called `garden_data.json`, located in the project‚Äôs root directory.

Example `garden_data.json` file:

```json
{
  "plants": ["tomatoes", "snow peas", "marigolds", "nasturtiums", "tulips", "orange tree"]
}
```

- The file is created automatically the first time you save your garden.
- Your garden starts with a default selection of plants, which are written to the file on save.
- Any new plants added during play are saved and automatically reloaded the next time you open the app.

---

## Platform Notes

- If `python` points to Python 2 on your system, use `python3`.
- If you don‚Äôt use a virtual environment (venv), you can still install dependencies globally with `pip` (or `pip3`).
- The app runs the same way on Windows, macOS, and Linux once dependencies are installed.

## Packages and Dependencies

| Package                    | Purpose                                               | Reason for Use                                                                  |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **colorama**               | Adds colour formatting to text output in the terminal | Improves readability and user experience                                        |
| **questionary**            | Provides interactive menus and prompts                | Simplifies command-line input and keeps UX friendly                             |
| **json** (Python built-in) | Reads and writes data to `garden_data.json`           | Enables persistent garden data storage                                          |
| **pytest**                 | Framework for running unit tests                      | Used to verify functions like `is_valid_seed` and ensure the app runs correctly |

---

## How It Works

The app uses two main classes and one entry-point function:

- `Garden` ‚Äî represents your garden and stores a list of plants.
- `GardenActions` ‚Äî contains all actions you can perform (watering, fertilising, planting, etc.).
- `main()` ‚Äî handles the user input loop, connects menu actions, and manages program flow.

Imported Libraries

- `colorama` ‚Äî adds colour to terminal text (for better readability).
- `questionary` ‚Äî provides interactive command-line menus for user input.
- `json` ‚Äî handles saving/loading your garden data.

Together, these components allow the user to interactively manage a persistent virtual garden through simple command-line prompts.

## Testing

Tests live in `test_garden_app.py`. Activate your virtual environment first (see Quickstart).

### 1) Install pytest (if not already installed)

```bash
pip install pytest
```

### 2) Run the whole test suite

```bash
pytest -q
```

The test suite covers:

- Valid and invalid seed types

```python
def test_is_valid_seed():
    assert is_valid_seed("orange tree")
    assert is_valid_seed("pumpkin")
    assert not is_valid_seed("apple")
    assert not is_valid_seed("")
    print("test_is_valid_seed passed.")
```

- Default garden plant list

```python
def test_garden_initial_plants():
    g = Garden()
    assert "tomatoes" in g.plants
    assert "tulips" in g.plants
    print("test_garden_initial_plants passed.")
```

- Adding new plants to the garden

```python
def test_garden_plant_addition():
    g = Garden()
    g.plants.append("pumpkin")
    assert "pumpkin" in g.plants
    print("test_garden_plant_addition passed.")
```

Useful testing commands:

```bash
# Run with more detail (verbose)
pytest -v

# Run a single test function by name
pytest -q -k test_is_valid_seed

# Stop on first failure
pytest -x

# Show print output (if any) during tests
pytest -s
```

## Ethical & Accessibility Considerations

- The app stores data locally only ‚Äî no internet access or external data sharing.
- Colour output improves usability but may affect accessibility for colour-blind users; future versions could include a ‚Äúno-colour‚Äù mode.
- Uses open-source libraries under approved licenses (see below).

## Troubleshooting

- **No colour in output:** Your terminal may not support ANSI colour codes.  
  Try running the app in Command Prompt, PowerShell, or Terminal.
- **Import errors:** Ensure dependencies are installed with  
  `pip install colorama questionary`.
- **Python not found:** Use `python3` or `py` depending on your OS.
