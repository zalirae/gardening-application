# FEEDBACK LOG
This is a collection of feedback from other teams on our Gardening Application, with suggestions on improvements that could be made to enhance the usability, understanding and working of our app.

**Feedback:**  
*(e.g., What worked, what didn't? How could we improve functionality? Is there something you wanted but wasn't there?)*

For my review, I looked at the the `README.md` file. Overall, I really like this document! I have included some specific feedback below:

- What worked:
    - Quickstart guide: I like how clear and easy to follow this section is, and I like your use of code blocks. I think it's great that you include the different instructions for each operating system.
    - Features: I LOVE that you included a GIF of the application in action! This is very cool to see how it runs. As a user, it's great to see what to expect up front (and as a visual learner, this is really helpful for me to better understand what the application is).
    - Data & Save File: I like how you include information about how the data is stored, and show what that file and data looks like. This is comforting to know I can check my save data so I don't lose my progress!
    - Project Structure: I like how you've broken this down visually, with the code comments explaining the purpose of each file. It's nice to know what each part does.
    - Testing: Similar to the Quickstart, I like how easy this is to follow, and how the information is presented clearly. The "useful testing commands" code block is especially helpful with those code comments explaining the commands.

- What could be improved:
    - The order of the README could be reorganised to flow better by grouping related sections together, e.g.:
        - Overview and Features (e.g., the opening section you have at the top + the "Features" section).
        - Usage (e.g., the "Quickstart" section and the "Testing" section).
        - Internal function (e.g., "How It Works", "Data & Save File", "Project Structure", etc.)
        - Legal/credits (e.g, "Ethical & Accessibility Considerations", "Licenses", "Contributors" and "References")
    - The "Packages and Dependencies" and "How It Works" sections could be combined, as there is some duplicated information about dependencies/imported libraries across these sections.
    - The "Licences" section copy/pastes the entire Colorama License. This text could be briefly summarised instead, with a link to the official license. That would reduce the length of the README, and also cover you if Colorama choose to update their license (i.e., if you're linking to the source content, it'll always be linking to the latest version, whereas a copy/pasted version could go out of date and become incorrect).
    
- What did I want that wasn't there?:
    - More examples of the application in use (this could be included as an additional file, if you don't want to bloat the README too much). As mentioned, I love that you've included the GIF! I think you could include some code blocks with copy/pasted terminal output in there too. That way, people can look through the text at their own pace (i.e., reading a code block) instead of watching the gif multiple times.

**Actionable improvements from given feedback:**
1. Update the order of the README to group like with like (e.g., Overview and Features, Usage, Internal Function, Legal/Credits).
2. Combine the "Packages and Dependencies" and "How It Works" sections to remove duplicated information.
3. Summarise the Colorama license and link to the official Colorama license instead.
4. Include additional examples of the application in use. These could be in the form of code blocks with copy/pasted terminal output, and screenshots. Providing different forms of this content enables readers to consume it in their preferred way.

The presentation of this document is immaculate, and the explanation of each section flows so well, and articulates the purpose/vision/usage of the app perfectly. I also liked the section on accessibility, I think that was done really well.

The only feedback I have, is that the README file doesn’t explicitly show the arguments, parameters and expected returned values for classes, methods, functions (only pytests) – it summarises them (which actually looks nicer), but it could have included some more explicit code blocks so show users how this app is functioning.

In the code source file, some of the code comments could have also had further explanation – the two section then would have complimented each other well.

**Actionable improvements from given feedback:**
1. Update the README file to include code blocks explaining arguments, parameters and returned values
2. Update code comments to provide a deeper understanding of how classes, functions and methods work

Missing explicit content about Ethical Considerations when you develop an application.

**Actionable improvements from given feedback:**
1. Create a section “Ethical Considerations” aligned with academic and open-source standards, focus on user privacy and autonomy, accessibility, transparency, and safety. These principles help ensure your app is respectful, inclusive, and trustworthy.

1. Strong Code Organisation and Readability
The code is well-structured and easy to follow, with clear naming
conventions and a logical separation between data (Garden class) and
actions (GardenActions). I also liked the inclusion of the GIF preview as it
helps users quickly understand what the app looks like and what features
they can access while playing.
2. Comprehensive and User-Friendly README
The README is detailed and written in simple, beginner-friendly language. It
clearly explains setup, dependencies, testing, and usage commands.
Including sections on ethical and accessibility considerations demonstrates
professionalism and an awareness of user experience and inclusivity.
3. Thoughtful Internal Review and Collaboration Process
The internal review shows strong teamwork and critical thinking. Each review
clearly presents the original code, the suggested improvements, and the
reasoning behind them, which highlights an organised and reflective
approach to collaboration.

**Actionable improvements from given feedback:**
1. Enhance Interactivity
User engagement could be further improved by adding small visual or
randomised elements, such as ASCII art or spontaneous garden events, to
make gameplay more dynamic and immersive (“Oh no! A bug ate your
plant!”). This would strengthen the app’s relaxing and creative theme.
2. Include a Troubleshooting Section
While the README is comprehensive, it currently lacks a troubleshooting
section. Adding one would enhance user experience by helping readers
quickly identify and resolve common setup or runtime issues. This would also
demonstrate strong user-centred thinking, showing that the developer has
considered potential challenges and provided clear guidance for smooth use
across different systems.
